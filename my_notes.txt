CORRECTIONS

*Honestly all css and javascript code needs to be refactored
    -The reason is because this was not writen to be scaleable or maintainable.
    -An improvement to the backend is that it could be written in laravel, which 
    is a php framework for more maintainablilty and scaleablity.


header.php 
file line 105 found a completely unnesscary extra </html>
merged all css into one file. 
having multiple rel calls = more server calls which slows down your website.
